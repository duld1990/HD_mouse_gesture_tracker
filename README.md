# HD_mouse_gesture_tracker
An AI-powered suite for animal behavior research. A GUI tool uses YOLOv11 to track pose in videos. A second application analyzes the resulting coordinate data, calculating open-field metrics and classifying complex behaviors (rearing, head turns) with an XGBoost model. Generates plots, heatmaps, and summary reports.

This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools for AI-powered animal tracking and detailed behavioral analysis, specifically designed for open-field experiments. The system utilizes a YOLOv11 model for multi-point pose estimation and a hybrid analysis tool with an XGBoost classifier to provide a complete pipeline from raw video to quantitative results.

Key Features
GUI-Based Video Tracking: An application (AI_mouse_tracker_v1.0.py) allows users to import a video, select a Region of Interest (ROI), and track multiple body landmarks (e.g., head, body center, tail base).

Advanced Behavioral Analysis: A second application (XGB_open_field_analysis_v2.0.py) processes the tracking data to calculate standard open-field metrics like total distance, average speed, and time spent in specific zones.

Hybrid Behavior Classification: The analysis tool uses a sophisticated hybrid system that combines rule-based logic with an XGBoost machine learning model to classify complex behaviors such as freezing, walking, rearing, grooming, and head turns.

Rich Data Output: The tools generate a variety of outputs, including CSV and NPZ files with coordinate data, summary tables, track plots, location heatmaps, and detailed behavior timelines.

Flexible Inference: The tracker supports multiple inference backends, including PyTorch, ONNX, and OpenVINO, for optimized performance.

Workflow
Train (Optional): Use YOLO_trainer_v1.2.py to prepare a dataset and train a custom YOLO model for detecting the body parts relevant to your experiment.

Track: Run the AI_mouse_tracker_v1.0.py application. Load a video and use the GUI to select an ROI and other parameters. The tool will process the video and save a CSV file containing the frame-by-frame coordinates of the tracked body parts.

Analyze: Open the XGB_open_field_analysis_v2.0.py application and load the CSV file generated by the tracker. This tool performs a deep analysis of the coordinates to produce final metrics, behavior classifications, plots, and summary reports.
