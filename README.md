# HD_mouse_gesture_tracker
An AI-powered suite for animal behavior research. A GUI tool uses YOLOv8 to track pose in videos. A second application analyzes the resulting coordinate data, calculating open-field metrics and classifying complex behaviors (rearing, head turns) with an XGBoost model. Generates plots, heatmaps, and summary reports.
